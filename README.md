# Population Simulator

This is a very crude population simulator. The program explains itself but...

# Parameters
- Deathrate is % of population per year
- Reprodcutionrate is multiplication factor of population
- Food consumption is amount of food consumed per person
- Farmer percent is percentage of people creating food
- Rate of food is amount of food coming from each farmer

*Note: A little inherit randomness is included, so results won\'t be exactly the same everytime.*

If **you** have any ideas for additions, please let me know in the issues section.
